  prompts:
  - If only I could make my way up to the temple, there might be some manuscripts
    that would prove useful.
  - Sadly with my old age, I don't think I could make it...
  - And don't you go trying yourself! It's far too dangerous for a young cone such
    as yourself.
  - Just wait here with me until we can reunite you with your parents.
