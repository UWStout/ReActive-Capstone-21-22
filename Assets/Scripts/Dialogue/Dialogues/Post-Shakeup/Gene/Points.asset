  prompts:
  - You see these here floating orbs?
  - Whatever you did yesterday made a bunch of these show up.
  - They contain a very strong negative charge that would make them great targets
    for the grapple shot.
  - Let me see if I can recall the instruction manual I scanned...
  - '"Aim at a grapple point and hold the left mouse button / right trigger to be
    pulled towards the point."'
  - Should be easy enough for you to figure out.
