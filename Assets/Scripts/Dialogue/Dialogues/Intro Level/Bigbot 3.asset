  prompts:
  - It was once our home. If only I could recall what it looked like... My memory
    was not designed to reach back so far.
  - I suppose you just activated? To be filled with such promise again.

  - I apologize. This must not be your future. My time has come to an end, but you
    still have wits about you.
  - Proceed to the nexus just beyond me. A vessel awaits you there. Take to the stars
    and make something of yourself.
  - ...
  - Oh... You can't jump that far, can you? I suppose I have a little power left.
