  prompts:
  - Behind me is a company issued power orb. If you see any, it is advised you collect
    them.
  - The energy of these power orbs can be used to open locked doors, if you have
    enough.
  - If you want to leave the factory, you'll need enough orbs to enter the launch
    pad.
  - Any locked door will display the number of orbs needed to open it.
  - If you want a better life, make sure to collect any power orb you find!
