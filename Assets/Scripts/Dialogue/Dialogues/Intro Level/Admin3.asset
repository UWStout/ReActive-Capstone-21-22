  prompts:
  - Ahead of me is a gap that must be crossed with a dash. Perform this maneuver
    using [shift/X].
  - You can use this at any time - even in the air. However, there is a short recovery
    time before you can use it again.
  - If you fall a large enough distance, you will likely be destroyed.
  - Behind me is a constructor pylon. Walk near it to upload your data to it.
  - If you are destroyed, you will be reconstructed at the last pylon you accessed.
  - If you are destroyed without accessing the pylon, a service member will have
    to go down and recycle you manually.
  - The cost of any severe damage may be deducted from your non-existent salary.
