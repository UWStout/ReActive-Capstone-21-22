  prompts:
  - Back through that tunnel there and across the gorge is a little town of sorts.
    Good place to get your head on straight.
  - A curious bunch, those folks. They don't hurt so long as you aren't the type
    to jump on a strangers head. Had to learn that the hard way.
  - Do watch out for those red ankle-biters, though. I don't know who spat in their
    oil, but I wouldn't get close enough to ask them.
