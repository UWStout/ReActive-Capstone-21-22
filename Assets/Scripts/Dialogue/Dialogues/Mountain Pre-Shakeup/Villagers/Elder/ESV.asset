  - Hmm, let's see. Many winters ago, before our people, a great cone wandered the
    sky.
  - it was magnificent and mighty, bigger than they eye can see and more blue than
    the coldest ice.
  - It wanderd and wandered and wandered, and when there was nowhere left to wander
    it wandered some more.
  - 'The cone had seen everything, been everyhwere, but still had no one to share
    its beauty with. '
  - And so the cone felt sorrowful. But it was also a clever cone, so then it thought.
    And thought and thought and thought, until it had an idea.
  - The cone, having seen all there was to find in the universe, found the sharpest
    rock and threw itself upon it. It shattered into a thousand brilliant pieces.
  - Alas, the great cone was no more.
  - In its place were many little cones, who rejoyced in their newfound life and
    would one day live together in harmony.
  - And so, the great cone was never lonely again.
