  prompts:
  - The statue? Don't be silly, all children know of Conehead the Pointy!
  - Don't worry, I'll tell it all the same.
  - You know not to leave the village, little one, because it is safe here. But why
    do you think the monsters stay out?
  - It was not always this way. Once, this land used to be many different lands.
    It was a dangerous time.
  - Our people were split amongst the islands, too afraid to unite for there were
    terrible beasts who patrolled the skies.
  - One brave little cone swore to bring an end to their tyranny. She battled the
    demons and walked the treacherous sky.
  - She came upon a shining tower, a gift of the great cone. With its power she joined
    our land and people, trapping the demons in holy ice.
  - And that is how our village came to be. She lives on in ice, as a reminder of
    our resolve to the monsters.
